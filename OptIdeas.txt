Improve erosion ideas
Background: We can see on the pictures that the erosion make a lot of lines.
1)  Eroding a 5x5 circle instead of 3x3.
    Argument: It would make erosion more accurate by 
    Result:
    
// Test method for it
    int array[EROSION_SIZE][EROSION_SIZE] = {0};

    for (int i = 0; i < EROSION_SIZE; i++)
    {
        int erosionCheck = (EROSION_SIZE - (abs(EROSION_SIZE / 2 - i) * 2) - 1) / 2;
        for (int j = (EROSION_SIZE / 2) - erosionCheck; j <= (EROSION_SIZE / 2) + erosionCheck; j++)
        {
            array[i][j] = 1;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < EROSION_SIZE; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < EROSION_SIZE; j++)
        {
            printf("%d", array[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }



Improve detection ideas.
1)  Make detection area a circle shape instead of a square.
    Argument: This makes sense as we are looking for circular shapes rather than square ones 
    and should make detecting closely positioned cells easier as there is a thin division between them.
    Result:

2) Make edge detection while thresholding image.


Improve memory management
1)  Make each pixel to one bit instead of 3 bytes.
2)  Dynamically allocated x & y coordinate arrays.
3)  Make Global variables to local?
